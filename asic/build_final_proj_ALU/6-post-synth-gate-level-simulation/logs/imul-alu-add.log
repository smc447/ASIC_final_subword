ProcDpathAluWrapper_proc_ProcDpathAlu_0, "ProcDpathAluWrapper_proc_ProcDpathAlu_DW01_add_J1_4_0 add_x_1( .A ({in0[31:22], n4, in0[20:0]}),  .B ({in1[31:5], n788, in1[3:1], n787}),  .CI (1'b0),  .SUM ({N112, N111, N110, N109, N108, N107, N106, N105, N104, N103, N102, N101, N100, N99, N98, N97, N96, N95, N94, N93, N92, N91, N90, N89, N88, N87, N86, N85, N84, N83, N82, N81}));"
  The above instance has fewer port connections than the module definition,
  There are 5 port(s) in module 
  "ProcDpathAluWrapper_proc_ProcDpathAlu_DW01_add_J1_4_0" definition, but only
  4 port connect(s) in the instance.
  output port 'CO' is not connected.
